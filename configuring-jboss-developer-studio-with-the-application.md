# Configuring JBoss Developer Studio with the application

You can also control the JBoss EAP runtime with JBoss Developer Studio by following the steps below.

Before starting, we will need to undeploy the application. In the terminal window, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/projects/monolith
mvn wildfly:start wildfly:undeploy wildfly:shutdown
```

Add the server installed in the previous step in the server tab by right clicking in the blank space, navigating on **new â†’ Server**.
