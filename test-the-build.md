# Test the build

Build and package the app using Maven to make sure you code still compiles. Click in the icon![]({% image_path /scenario1/image22.png %}) 

and then monolith

![]({% image_path /scenario1/image29.png %})  

If builds successfully \(you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`\), then let's move on to the next issue! If it does not compile, verify you made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

![]({% image_path /scenario1/image40.png %})
