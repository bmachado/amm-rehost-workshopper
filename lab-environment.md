# Lab Environment

We provisioned an Openshift cluster for you with everything you need to run our labs. Before starting, you need to obtain your own GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) to access your Openshift.

A link is usually shared by your instructor with its **Lab Code** and **Activation Key**. After it, you will receive your GUID, please take note if it!
