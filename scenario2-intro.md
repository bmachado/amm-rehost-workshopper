# SCENARIO 2: A Developer Introduction to OpenShift

In the previous scenario you learned how to take an existing application to the cloud with JBoss EAP and OpenShift, and you got a glimpse into the power of OpenShift for existing applications.

In this scenario you will go deeper into how to use the OpenShift Container Platform as a developer to build and deploy applications. We'll focus on the core features of OpenShift as it relates to developers, and you'll learn typical workflows for a developer \(develop, build, test, deploy, and repeat\).
