# Re-Run the RHAMT report

In this step we will re-run the RHAMT report to verify our migration was successful.

1. Run RHAMT again on the project to eliminate the issues already fixed. Click in the ![]({% image_path /scenario1/image22.png %})icon and then Run\_configuration

![]({% image_path /scenario1/image17.png %})

  
Wait for it to complete before continuing!. You should see Report tab:

![]({% image_path /scenario1/image65.png %})

2. View the results

Verify that it now reports 0 Story Points:

You have successfully migrated this app to JBoss EAP, congratulations!

Ensure RHAMT Server is not running in the Issue Explorer tab. If it's running, just click in its stop button.
