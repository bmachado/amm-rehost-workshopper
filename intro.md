# Intro

In this scenario you will see how easy it is to migrate from legacy platforms to JBoss EAP. We'll answer questions like:

* Why move applications to OCP and cloud?
* What does the lift and shift process look like?

We will then take the following steps to migrate \(lift & shift\) an existing Java EE app to EAP+OpenShift using [Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhamt/overview/) \(RHAMT\)

* Analyze existing WebLogic monolith application using RHAMT.
* Review the report and update code and config to run on JBoss EAP
* Deploy to OpenShift
* Use OpenShift features like automatic clustering and failover to enhance the application
